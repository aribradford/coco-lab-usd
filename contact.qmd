## Prospective research assistants

Prospective USD undergraduate research assistants can [submit an application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPEhmiT6rkjqMjihAvBGpRfWQm33oPi2_DWAbfYHKFksqztg/viewform?usp=dialog) for consideration. You must use your USD login to access the application form. I recruit research assistants on a fluctuating, rolling basis depending on project needs and fit.
